            <h2>Anfield</h2>
            <p>Anfield is a football stadium in Anfield, Liverpool, Merseyside, England, which
                has a seating capacity of 53,394, making it the seventh largest football stadium
                in England. It has been the home of Liverpool Football Club since their formation
                in 1892. It was originally the home of Everton from 1884 to 1891, before they moved
                to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president.
            </p>
            <h3>Historical Facts</h3>

            <p>
                The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand
                and the Anfield Road End. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between
                Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an all-seater
                stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity.
                Two gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and
                Bob Paisley.

            <h3>Transport</h3>
            <p>
                The stadium is about 2 miles (3 km) from Lime Street Station, which lies on a branch
                of the West Coast Main Line from London Euston. Kirkdale Station, about 1 mile (1.6 km)
                from the stadium, is the nearest station to Anfield. Fans travelling by train for matches
                may book direct to Anfield or Goodison Park, changing to the Peoplesbus Soccerbus service
                at Sandhills Station on the Merseyrail Northern Line. The stadium has no parking facilities
                for supporters, and the streets around the ground allow parking only for residents with permits,
                although there are a small number of passes that can be allocated to over-65s. There are proposals
                under consideration for reinstating passenger traffic on the Bootle Branch, which would cut the
                distance from the nearest railway station to about 0.5 miles (1 km)
